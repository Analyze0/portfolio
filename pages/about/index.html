    Hey, I'm Quinn! At the age of ten, I started learning programming by messing around with other peoples projects.
    Once I got a bit better, I began creating small projects such as calculators and text-based
    choose-your-own-adventure games in the C++ console.Over the years, I have developed a pretty decent understanding of
    various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


    Currently, I am focusing on web development and working to further develop my skills. Being a
    thirteen-year-old programmer, I am always excited for new challenges to keep me learning and help me grow as a
    programmer!
